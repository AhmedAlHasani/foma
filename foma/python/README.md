# Python Extras

## foma.py

This is a foma interface implemented in Python. Requires libfoma installed.

## attapply.py

This is a stand-alone Python utility for reading AT\&T files and applying transductions.  Useful for minimizing dependencies. Also supports weighted transducers, in which case `apply()` returns output strings in least-cost order.
